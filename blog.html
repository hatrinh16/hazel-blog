        Aquarius constellation is faint and one of the largest constellations in the southern hemisphere. Its name is water bearer in Latin and is introduced in the 2nd century CE by famous Greek astronomer Ptolemy. The constellation contains only stars not brighter than magnitude 3.0 and it lies on the ecliptic so could be easily seen from both hemispheres.

    <h2>Daily Horoscope </h2>
    <p>
        Don't confuse high standards with unrealistic expectations this morning, dear Aquarius, as the Cancer moon and Pluto face off. This cosmic climate could cause you to become extra sensitive, and it will be difficult to take criticism from others, no matter how constructive it may be. Give yourself permission to regroup from under the radar once Mercury enters Capricorn, nudging you to embrace more solitude throughout the coming weeks. Luckily, you won't feel completely alone once the moon enters Leo and your house or relationships, inspiring you to find comfort in the people who act as your biggest cheerleaders.
